Comments:       A lightweight, versatile package manager for Linux distros that
                enables a user to perform various operations such as:
                copy, extract, download, find which package a file belongs to,
                install/uninstall/unload (different package versions) to
                specified locations, list installed packages, make packages
                (with optional compile step), list dependency trees, validate
                and repair package contents, and open a fifo for network client
                operation.  There's even the ability to proxy several actions
                to a different device!
                ----
                This is a more feature full and efficient package manager than
                the default that is included in the TC distro. It can also be
                installed as the default for command line use.
                  [PLANNED UPDATES]
                There are several planned updates that will eventually be
                added. Patches or donations are welcome and will expedite

                - More proxy actions
                - A graphical interface
