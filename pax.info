overview:	A very robust package manager for Linux distros that enables a
		user to perform various operations such as:
		copy, extract, download, find which package a file belongs to,
		install/uninstall/unload, list installed packages, make
		packages (with optional compile step), list dependency trees,
		validate and repair package contents, and open a fifo for
		network client operation.  There's even the ability to proxy
		several actions to a different device.
comments:	This is a more feature full pax manager than the default that
		is included in the TC distro. It can also be installed as the
		default.
		[PLANNED UPDATES]
		There are several planned updates that will eventually be
		added. Patches or donations are welcome and will expedite
		future updates. Features include:
		- Concise package listing (instead of current 2 line)
		- An 'html' output option
		- More proxy actions
		- Automated package checking/downloading/installing
		- Ability to search online repos (including server-side)
		- A network server to push/manipulate packages to/on clients
		- Ability to process .deb (and other) packages
		[OTHER PROJECTS]
		builder - a tool to easily build software
		dittodata - a data backup/copy tool
		fxWM - a lightweight window manager configured via css
		web.de - a web-based desktop environment
